##Programming languages
Java was used to code all the business logic and entity classes as well as part of the front end. Additionally HTML and CSS were used for the look of the website and Javascript to communicate with Ajax which was used to detect clicks and forward info back to the Java part of the front end.

##Coding Rules

###Java
Below are listed the various coding rules when writing our Java code
* All classes have Pascalcasing
* All functions, function parameters and member variables have camelCasing
* Stroustrup style is used for curly braces
* The code follows good Object orientation
* The business logic is written with test-driven development
* Member variables are private
* Test functions are named "function name" + "name of test" + "Test"

###CSS
Below is a short list of the coding rules we associated with all CSS code
* All variable names are written with lowercase letters and with a dash in between words.
* Stroustrup style is used for curly braces


##Design
The initial design revolved around creating an entity class Square and making the tic-tac-toe board an array of such squares inside the business layer. At first a class "Player" was created to track each players' moves but it proved unnecesary and was removed. The business layer takes care of any interpretation and manipulations of the board state which the front end retrieves and displays. The game is hosted on a web server through Heroku. When a particular square is pressed the UI forwards that information back to the backend which communicates with the business layer. The business layer then answers the frontend of the backend which processes the information and sends back the current board state as a Json string. The UI then displays the board state retrieved. After a winner has been found the Business layer simply stops updating the board no matter the move.
