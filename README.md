This project is a part of a software engineering course in [RU(Reykjavík University)](https://www.ru.is/). The job is to implement the game TicTacToe.
The prime **goal** however is to follow the best practices in software development, and to to do so there are few higly important things to note:


* The code is stored in source control system on GitHub
* The system is setup with automatic build script.
* The build script runs all unit tests.
* use TDD(Test driven development)
* The code should be loosely coupled and follow good object oriented
design practices.
* Documentation uses Markdown syntax.
* Use Automated Continuous Integration Server (e.g.Travis CI).
* Use feature branches and pull request for all features


Here are the group members enlisted:
* Alex Már Gunnarsson
