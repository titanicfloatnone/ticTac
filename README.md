## About the project
This project is a part of a software engineering course in [RU(Reykjavík University)](https://www.ru.is/). The job is to implement the game TicTacToe.
The prime **goal** however is to follow the best practices in software development, and to to do so there are few higly important things to note:


* The code is stored in source control system on GitHub
* The system is setup with automatic build script
* The build script runs all unit tests
* use TDD(Test driven development)
* The code should be loosely coupled and follow good object oriented
design practices
* Documentation uses Markdown syntax
* Use Automated Continuous Integration Server (e.g.Travis CI)
* Use feature branches and pull request for all features

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xwzi7bpgs7nhmaq/AADrmGoYLjbNgMiQn5dXhaZ7a?dl=0) is our complete documentation and code coverage history stored on Dropbox.
